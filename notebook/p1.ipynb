      "      potentially damaging effects of AR in diabetes were first discovered in the lens fiber cells.\n",
      "      In these cells, the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of high levels of glucose to sorbitol\n",
      "      through the polyol pathway and initiates a sequence of events that eventually results in\n",
      "      opacification of the lens. Because sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) and fructose (a subsequent\n",
      "      product of glucose metabolism) cannot readily diffuse across cell membranes, they become\n",
      "      trapped in lens fiber cells. There they accumulate at unusually high levels and exert a\n",
      "      significant osmotic stress, causing an influx of water and swelling of the lens fibers. Major\n",
      "      electrolytic and osmotic changes then occur that lead to lens opacity.\n",
